## Cassandra with Metrics Stack

I created this to test out sending metrics from _Cassandra_ to _Grafana_.

#### TODO
- Remove hard coded IP in metrics\_reporter_graphite.yaml
- Add some test tables to cassandra and feed some random data into it
- Fetch the metrics-graphite.jar on build and remove from repo
